Judith:  Any Anti-Imperialist group like ours must *reflect* such a
         divergence of interests within its power-base.
Reg:     Agreed.
         (General nodding.)
         Francis?
Francis: I think Judith's point of view is valid here, Reg, provided the
         Movement never forgets that it is the inalienable right of every
         man--
Stan:    Or woman.
Francis: Or woman ... to rid himself ...
Stan:    Or herself.
Reg:     Or herself.  Agreed.  Thank you, brother.
Stan:    Or sister.
Francis: Thank you, brother.  Or sister.  Where was I?
Reg:     I thought you'd finished.
Francis: Oh, did I?  Right.
Reg:     Furthermore, it is the birthright of every man ...
Stan:    Or woman.
Reg:     Why don't you shut up about women, Stan, you're putting us off.
Stan:    Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg.
Francis: Why are you always on about women, Stan?
Stan:    (pause) I want to be one.

(pause)

Reg:    What?
Stan:   I want to be a woman.  From now on I want you all to call me Loretta.
Reg:    What!?
Stan:   It's my right as a man.
Judith: Why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
Stan:   I want to have babies.
Reg:    You want to have babies?!?!?!
Stan:   It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
Reg:    But you can't have babies.
Stan:   Don't you oppress me.
Reg:    I'm not oppressing you, Stan -- you haven't got a womb.  Where's the
        fetus going to gestate?  You going to keep it in a box?
(Stan starts crying.)
Judith:  Here!  I've got an idea.  Suppose you agree that he can't actually
         have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the
         Romans', but that he can have the *right* to have babies.
Francis: Good idea, Judith.  We shall fight the oppressors for your right to
         have babies, brother.  Sister, sorry.
Reg:     What's the *point*?
Francis:  What?
Reg:      What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies, when he
          can't have babies?
Francis:  It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
Reg:      It's symbolic of his struggle against reality.
